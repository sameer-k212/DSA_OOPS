//Suppose you have a sorted array of infinite numbers, how would you search an
//element in the array?

//Source: Amazon Interview Experience.

//Since array is sorted, the first thing clicks into mind is binary search, but the
//problem here is that we don't know size of array.
//If the array is infinite, that means we don't have proper bounds to apply binary
//search. So in order to find position of key, first we find bounds and then apply
//binary search algorithm.
//Let low be pointing to 1st element and high pointing to 2nd element of array, Now
//compare key with high index element,
//->if it is greater than high index element then copy high index in low index and
//double the high index.
//->if it is smaller, then apply binary search on high and low indices found.

// -- you can solve it by using .length but pls avoid bcz its infinite array 
// -- you can solve by linear search but that is not the correct way  -- time complexity - O(n)
// -- you can solve using two pointer approach but again thats not the correct way -- time complexity - O(n)
// Since its given that array is sorted  soo try to apply Binary Search
